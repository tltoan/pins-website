      <section>
        <h2>Why We Built Pins</h2>
        <p>
          Social media turned our family memories into performance art. We wanted 
          to bring back authentic moment capture - the real laughs, the terrible 
          dad jokes, the actual weather that made the day perfect.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Pins is designed for families spread across the country, friends staying 
          connected without algorithms, and anyone who wants to remember life as 
          it actually happened.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          To help families create a private, meaningful record of their lives together. No ads, no algorithms, no anxiety. Just real moments, mapped beautifully over time.
        </p>

        <h2>What Makes Pins Different</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Privacy First:</strong> All pins private by default, you control every share</li>
          <li><strong>Context Rich:</strong> Dual photos, voice, location, weather captured automatically</li>
          <li><strong>Discovery Magic:</strong> Find authentic stories left at public places</li>
          <li><strong>Family Focused:</strong> Built for intimate connections, not viral content</li>
          <li><strong>No Algorithm:</strong> Your timeline, your friends, your choice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Team</h2>
        <p>
          We're a small team of parents, designers, and engineers who believe technology should bring families closer together, not push them apart. We've felt the pain of losing photos in cloud services, the frustration of scattered memories across different apps, and the sadness of realizing our kids' childhoods were disappearing into the digital void.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every feature in Pins comes from our own experiences as parents trying to capture and preserve our families' stories.

        <h2>Join Our Journey</h2>
        <p>
          Pins is more than an app‚Äîit's a movement away from performative social media and toward authentic memory-keeping. Every family that joins makes our community stronger and our mission clearer.
