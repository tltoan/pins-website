        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        
        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        
        <div style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
          <p><strong>How do I create an account?</strong></p>
          <p>Download Pins from the App Store, open the app, and follow the simple signup process. You'll need an email address and to create a username.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
          <p><strong>Is Pins really free?</strong></p>
          <p>Yes! The basic version of Pins is completely free forever. You can create unlimited pins, use all capture features, and share with up to 10 friends. Premium features are available for those who want more.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
          <p><strong>Is Pins available for Android?</strong></p>
          <p>Not yet, but we're working on it! Join our Android waitlist on the homepage to be notified when it launches.</p>

        <h3>Privacy & Security</h3>
        
        <div style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
          <p><strong>Is my data really private?</strong></p>
          <p>Absolutely. Your pins are private by default and only visible to you unless you explicitly choose to share them. We never sell your data, show ads, or share your information with third parties.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
          <p><strong>Can I delete my data?</strong></p>
          <p>Yes, you have complete control. You can delete individual pins, clear your entire history, or delete your account entirely. When you delete something, it's permanently removed from our servers.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
          <p><strong>Who can see my pins?</strong></p>
          <p>By default, only you can see your pins. You can choose to share specific pins with friends you've connected with. There are no public profiles or discovery features unless you explicitly make a pin public.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

        <h3>Features & Usage</h3>
        
        <div style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
          <p><strong>What is dual-camera capture?</strong></p>
          <p>Dual-camera capture lets you take a photo with both your front and back cameras simultaneously, similar to BeReal. It captures both your view and your reaction in a single moment.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
          <p><strong>How long can voice notes be?</strong></p>
          <p>Voice notes can be up to 90 seconds long. This gives you enough time to capture the story behind the moment without creating huge files.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
          <p><strong>What are Daily Adventures?</strong></p>
          <p>Every morning, Pins creates a beautiful summary of your previous day's journey, showing where you went and what you captured. It's like a personal diary that writes itself.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
          <p><strong>How does friend sharing work?</strong></p>
          <p>You can connect with friends using unique friend codes. Once connected, you can choose to share specific pins with them. There's no public feed or follower system.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Premium & Billing</h3>
        
        <div style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
          <p><strong>What's included in Premium?</strong></p>
          <p>Premium includes unlimited friend connections, friend groups, unlimited discovery pins, full history access, cloud backup, priority support, and early access to new features.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
          <p><strong>How do I upgrade to Premium?</strong></p>
          <p>Open the app, go to Settings, and tap on "Upgrade to Premium". You'll be taken through the App Store subscription process.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
          <p><strong>Can I cancel anytime?</strong></p>
          <p>Yes! You can cancel your subscription anytime through your App Store settings. You'll keep Premium features until the end of your billing period.</p>

        <h3>Technical Issues</h3>
        
        <div style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
          <p><strong>The app is crashing. What should I do?</strong></p>
          <p>First, try updating to the latest version from the App Store. If that doesn't help, try deleting and reinstalling the app. Your data is safely backed up. If problems persist, contact support@pinsapp.com.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
          <p><strong>Location isn't working correctly.</strong></p>
          <p>Make sure you've granted Pins permission to access your location in your iPhone settings. Go to Settings > Pins > Location and select "While Using App".</p>
        </div>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
          <p><strong>My photos aren't uploading.</strong></p>
          <p>Check your internet connection first. If you're on cellular, make sure you haven't restricted Pins from using cellular data. Large photos may take time to upload on slower connections.</p>
